      <p>
        I started coding back in 2004 with the advent of myspace when html
        templates started floating around and I discovered a magical world of
        customizations. I had so much fun with the limitless options, but I was
        not conditioned to pursue things that were fun, so I didn't even
        conceive of this being a career and just carried on with my day-to-day
        life. I always felt giddy and mischevious after each little change I
        made on one of my pages though, like I knew a secret that not many had
        the priviledge of knowing. After 10 long years of choosing a career
        centered on money alone and making it to Salesforce and Google, I find
        myself bored, unfulfilled, and burnt out. So I quit my job and joined a
        bootcamp! Now I finally get to pursue a long overdue dream of coding,
        where I can actually have fun doing something that I can get paid for!
