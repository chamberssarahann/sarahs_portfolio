# Sarah's Portfolio

## Description

I created this portfolio as part of an assignment to have all of my projects in one place. More than that, I also wanted to showcase what I've learned so far, so that potential employers can see my passion for design and get an interactive demonstration of how I code from scratch after just two weeks in this bootcamp. My biggest challenge was the flex boxes. At first I created one div called big project and one div called smaller projects, but without a wrapper or overarching container, the smaller projects would not wrap to the right of the larger project when the viewport was widened. So I created a wrapper, made that a flex box and gave it a wrap property, and that enabled me to acheive the wrapping and the responsiveness I was looking for. I learned a lot about naming conventions and problem solving. I also learned a lot about the importance of commits, as sometimes I had to start an entire section over because I couldn't figure out what was preventing my style from applying.

## Installation

No installation required, as it's just a webpage. Simply load it on your favorite browser, and as long as you're connected to the internet, it should conform seamlessly to any viewport thanks to the responsive design. 

## Usage

This site is intended to be used as kind of a live resume where I'll update it as my skills improve, and it'll continue to look and behave better as I learn more ways to make it engaging, responsive, or just overall designed better. I'll continue updating it with all of my projects and repos, and the social media links will enable any potential employer or collaborator to get ahold of me easily.
