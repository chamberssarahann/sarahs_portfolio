             <p>I started coding back in 2004 with the advent of myspace when html templates started floating around and I discovered a magical world of customizations. I had so much fun with the limitless options, but I was not conditioned to pursue things that were fun, so I didn't even conceive of this being a career and just carried on with my day-to-day life. I always felt giddy and mischevious after each little change I made on one of my pages though, like I knew a secret that not many had the priviledge of knowing. After 10 long years of choosing a career centered on money alone and making it to Salesforce and Google, I find myself bored, unfulfilled, and burnt out. So I quit my job and joined a bootcamp! Now I finally get to pursue a long overdue dream of coding, where I can actually have fun doing something that I can get paid for!
